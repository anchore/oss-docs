An SBOM, or Software Bill of Materials, is a detailed list of all the components, libraries, and modules that make up a piece of software. 

For a developer, having an SBOM is crucial for tracking dependencies, quickly identifying known vulnerabilities within those components, and ensuring license compliance. 

For a consumer or organization using the software, an SBOM provides transparency into the software's supply chain, allowing them to assess potential security risks and understand what's "under the hood." Â  

Syft is an open-source command-line tool and Go library. Its primary function is to scan container images, file systems, and archives to automatically generate a Software Bill of Materials, making it easier to understand the composition of software.
