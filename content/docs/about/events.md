## Open Source Live Streams

Almost every Thursday the OSS team holds a "Gardening" live stream on the [Anchore YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/anchore/). Each week, we announce what time the live stream is happening in the [Announcements](https://anchorecommunity.discourse.group/tags/c/announcements/7/gardening) on [Discourse](https://anchore.com/discourse/).

The streams are recorded and archived in our [Live stream playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXk4zTKyovg&list=PL4LF17QFqXYZsXvQUL8PWwSN0ZnthPRMm).

## Community Meetings

We hold open meetings with the community, on alternate Thursdays. These are on [Zoom](https://anchore.zoom.us/j/81381667101?pwd=MlBVQVk2SVR2enU2YkppamNLK3RWQT09), and are _not_ recorded or streamed. There is an optional [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtSAa6fj2a6KRWviTn3WoJm09edvrNUp4Iz_dOjjyY8/edit) which can be filled in. Everyone is welcome. A webcam is not required.

## Anchore Events

Anchore has a separate [Events page](https://anchore.com/events/), for announcing industry & corporate events, and webinars.
