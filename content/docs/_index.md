### Installing the Tools

The tools are available in many common distribution channels. The full list of official and community maintained packages can be found on the [installation](/docs/installation) page.

### Using the Tools

We have "Getting Started" user guides for [SBOM Generation](/docs/userguides/sbom/getstarted) with Syft, [Vulnerability Scanning](/docs/userguides/sbom/getstarted) with Grype, and [License Scanning](/docs/userguides/license/getstarted).

### Developing

Developers also have [Contribution Guides](/docs/contributing/) for all of our open source tools and libraries.
