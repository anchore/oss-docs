## Release Notes:
Version [v0.79.1](https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases/tag/v0.79.1)

### Updates

- update CI to install golang at the latest version [[#1949](https://github.com/anchore/grype/pull/1949) [@spiffcs](https://github.com/spiffcs)]
- Grype is now built with the latest version of Golang at v1.22.x. This resolves a few security findings that would have been flagged against the v0.79.0 binary for using an older version of the Golang standard library.
