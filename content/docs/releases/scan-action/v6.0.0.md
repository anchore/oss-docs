## Release Notes:
Version [v6.0.0](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action/releases/tag/v6.0.0)

## New in scan-action v6.0.0

### Breaking Change
- feat: add output-file option, default to random directory output in temp (#346) [[kzantow](https://github.com/kzantow)]

The action no longer generates files in your working directory by default, instead you should use the action outputs: `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.sarif }}` where the `<id>` needs to match the `id` you configured to reference the `scan-action`, e.g.:
```yaml
      - uses: anchore/scan-action[@v6](https://github.com/v6)
        id: scan
        ...
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif[@v3](https://github.com/v3)
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.sarif }}
```
