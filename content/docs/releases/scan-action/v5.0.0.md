## Release Notes

Version [v5.0.0](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

## New in scan-action v5.0.0

- chore(deps): update Grype to v0.82.0 (#383) [[anchore-actions-token-generator](https://github.com/anchore-actions-token-generator)]

## ðŸš€ Features

- feat: short-lived grype-db cache (#348) [[kzantow](https://github.com/kzantow)]
Note: with this release grype is no longer installed on `$PATH`. We suspect the changes here could break a number of users of the action who have learned to expect Grype be installed on `$PATH`.
