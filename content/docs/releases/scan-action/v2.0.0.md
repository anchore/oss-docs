## Release Notes

Version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

New major version of scan action based on new [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) tool from Anchore that is much faster for scanning compared to v1.x and adds some new capabilities and more metadata about the matches.

* Significantly faster performance for scans
* New vulnerabilities output format is the JSON output from Grype directly
* Adds support for scanning directories as well as Docker containers, so you can do the same checks pre-and post-build of the container.
* Supports Automatic Code Scanning/SARIF for exposing results via your repository's _Security_ tab.

This is a breaking change from v1.x, as indicated by the major version revision:

1. Use `image` input parameter Instead of `image-reference`
2. `dockerfile-path` is no longer supported and not necessary for the vulnerability scans
3. `custom-policy-path` is no longer supported
4. `include-app-packages` is no longer necessary or supported. Application packages are on by default and will receive vulnerability matches.
5. Outputs:
   1. `billofmaterials` is no longer output. V2 is focused on vulnerability scanning and another action may be introduced for BoM support with its own options/config.
   2. `policycheck` is no longer output
