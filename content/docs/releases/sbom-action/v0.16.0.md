## Release Notes

Version [v0.16.0](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action/releases/tag/v0.16.0)

## Changes in v0.16.0

- Update Syft to v1.4.1 (#465)
- Update GitHub artifact client (#463) [[kzantow](https://github.com/kzantow)]

NOTE: if you are using this action within a _matrix build_ and see failures attempting to upload artifacts with duplicate names, you will need to set the `artifact-name` to be unique based on the matrix properties ([an example here](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L36)). This is due to a change to use a newer GitHub API which no longer allows artifacts with duplicate names.
